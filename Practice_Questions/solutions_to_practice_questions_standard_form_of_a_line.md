# Solutions to Practice Problems - Standard Form of a Linear Equation

## Problem 1
The standard form of a linear equation is $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers, and $A$ is typically non-negative.

Starting equation:  
$y = \frac{2}{5} x + \frac{1}{5}$

**Step 1:** Subtract $\frac{2}{5} x$ from both sides:  
$y - \frac{2}{5} x = \frac{1}{5}$

**Step 2:** Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fractions:  
$5y - 2x = 1$

**Step 3:** Multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of $x$ positive:  
$2x - 5y = -1$

Final standard form:  
$2x - 5y = -1$

## Problem 2

Convert the equation $3x = -\frac{1}{7}y + 1$ to standard form $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers, and $A$ is non-negative.

Starting equation:  
$3x = -\frac{1}{7}y + 1$

**Step 1:** Add $\frac{1}{7}y$ to both sides:  
$3x + \frac{1}{7}y = 1$

**Step 2:** Multiply both sides by 7 to clear the fraction:  
$21x + y = 7$

The coefficient of $x$ is already positive.

Final standard form:  
$21x + y = 7$

## Problem 3

Convert the equation $\frac{2}{3}y - \frac{1}{5}x + \frac{1}{\pi} = 0$ to standard form $Ax + By = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are integers, and $A$ is non-negative.

Starting equation:  
$\frac{2}{3}y - \frac{1}{5}x + \frac{1}{\pi} = 0$

**Step 1:** Move the constant term to the right side:  
$\frac{2}{3}y - \frac{1}{5}x = -\frac{1}{\pi}$

**Step 2:** Multiply both sides by $-1$ (to make the $x$-coefficient positive later):  
$-\frac{2}{3}y + \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{1}{\pi}$

**Step 3:** Rearrange to group $x$ and $y$ terms (optional, for clarity):  
$\frac{1}{5}x - \frac{2}{3}y = \frac{1}{\pi}$

**Step 4:** Multiply through by $15\pi$ (least common multiple of denominators 5 and 3, including $\pi$):  
$15\pi \cdot \frac{1}{5}x - 15\pi \cdot \frac{2}{3}y = 15\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\pi}$  
$3\pi x - 10\pi y = 15$

The coefficient of $x$ ($3\pi$) is positive.

Final standard form (with integer coefficients):  
$3\pi x - 10\pi y = 15$

(Note: This is acceptable when irrational constants like $\pi$ are present; alternatively, factor out $\pi$: $\pi(3x - 10y) = 15$, but the expanded form matches $Ax + By = C$.)
