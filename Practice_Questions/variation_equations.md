# Lesson - Variation Equations
## Solutions to Practice Problems

### Question 1: Direct Variation – Cost of Apples
The cost \( y \) varies directly with the weight \( x \).

**Given:** 5 kg costs $12. Find the cost of 8 kg.

**Step 1:** Write the direct variation equation  
$$ y = kx $$

**Step 2:** Find the constant \( k \)  
$$ 12 = k \cdot 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 $$

**Step 3:** Write the specific equation  
$$ y = 2.4x $$

**Step 4:** Cost for 8 kg  
$$ y = 2.4 \cdot 8 = 19.2 $$

**Answer:** 8 kg of apples costs **$19.20**.

### Question 2: Direct Variation – Distance and Time
The distance \( d \) a car travels varies directly with time \( t \).  
The car travels 240 km in 4 hours.

**a) Equation of variation**  
$$ d = kt $$  
$$ 240 = k \cdot 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 60 $$  
$$ d = 60t $$

**b) Distance in 7 hours**  
$$ d = 60 \cdot 7 = 420 $$  
**Answer:** **420 km**

**c) Time to travel 450 km**  
$$ 450 = 60t \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{450}{60} = 7.5 $$  
**Answer:** **7.5 hours**

### Question 3: Inverse Variation
\( y \) varies inversely with \( x \), and \( y = 12 \) when \( x = 3 \).  
Find \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).

**Step 1:** Inverse variation form  
$$ y = \frac{k}{x} \quad \text{or} \quad xy = k $$

**Step 2:** Find \( k \)  
$$ 3 \cdot 12 = k \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 36 $$

**Step 3:** Specific equation  
$$ y = \frac{36}{x} $$

**Step 4:** When \( x = 4 \)  
$$ y = \frac{36}{4} = 9 $$

**Answer:** \( y = 9 \)

### Question 4: Inverse Variation – Painters and Time
Time \( t \) varies inversely with the number of painters \( p \).  
4 painters take 6 hours.

**Step 1:**  
$$ tp = k $$

**Step 2:** Find \( k \)  
$$ 4 \cdot 6 = k \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 24 $$  
$$ tp = 24 $$

**Step 3:** Painters needed for 3 hours  
$$ 3 \cdot p = 24 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p = 8 $$

**Answer:** **8 painters** are needed.

### Question 5: Combined Direct + Inverse-as-a-Power (No Negative Exponents)
The force \( F \) varies directly with the stretch distance \( d \) and inversely as the cube of the wire thickness \( t \).  
When \( d = 5 \) cm and \( t = 2 \) mm, \( F = 40 \) N.

**Part 1:** Write the equation and find \( k \)  
The variation statement gives:  
$$ F = k \cdot \frac{d}{t^3} $$

Substitute the known values:  
$$ 40 = k \cdot \frac{5}{2^3} = k \cdot \frac{5}{8} = k \cdot \frac{5}{8} $$  
$$ k = 40 \cdot \frac{8}{5} = 64 $$

**Final equation:**  
$$ F = 64 \cdot \frac{d}{t^3} $$

**Part 2:** Force needed for \( d = 8 \) cm and \( t = 1 \) mm  
$$ F = 64 \cdot \frac{8}{1^3} = 64 \cdot 8 = 512 $$

**Answer:** **512 newtons**

(Quick check: distance ×1.6, thickness halved → \( t^3 \) becomes 1/8 of original → force multiplies by \( 1.6 \times 8 = 12.8 \).  
\( 40 \times 12.8 = 512 \) N ✓)
