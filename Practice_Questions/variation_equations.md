# Lesson - Variation Equations

## Solutions to Practice Problems

### 1. Direct Variation Problem Solution

In this problem, the cost of apples (price, \( y \)) varies directly with their weight (\( x \)). This means the relationship can be expressed as:
\[
y = kx
\]
where \( k \) is the constant of variation (or constant of proportionality).

#### Step 1: Find the Constant \( k \)
We are given that 5 kg of apples costs $12. Substitute the known values into the equation:
\[
12 = k \cdot 5
\]
Solve for \( k \):
\[
k = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4
\]
So, the constant of variation is 2.4 (which means $2.40 per kg).

#### Step 2: Write the Variation Equation
Using the value of \( k \), the equation becomes:
\[
y = 2.4x
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Cost for 8 kg
Now, substitute \( x = 8 \) kg into the equation to find \( y \):
\[
y = 2.4 \cdot 8 = 19.2
\]
Therefore, 8 kg of apples would cost $19.20.
