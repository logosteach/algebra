# Lesson – Variation Equations  
## Solutions to Practice Problems (GitHub-Friendly Version)

### 1. Direct Variation – Cost of Apples  
The cost (y) varies directly with weight (x).  
5 kg costs $12 → How much for 8 kg?

**Step 1:** y = kx  
**Step 2:** 12 = k × 5 → k = 12/5 = 2.4  
**Step 3:** y = 2.4x  
**Step 4:** y = 2.4 × 8 = 19.2  

**Answer:** 8 kg costs **$19.20**

### 2. Direct Variation – Distance and Time  
Distance (d) varies directly with time (t).  
240 km in 4 hours.

**a) Equation**  
d = kt → 240 = k × 4 → k = 60  
**d = 60t** (60 km/h)

**b) In 7 hours**  
d = 60 × 7 = **420 km**

**c) Time for 450 km**  
450 = 60t → t = 450/60 = **7.5 hours**

### 3. Inverse Variation  
y varies inversely with x.  
y = 12 when x = 3 → Find y when x = 4.

**Step 1:** y = k/x  (or  xy = k)**  
3 × 12 = k → k = 36  
y = 36/x  

When x = 4:  
y = 36/4 = **9**

**Answer:** y = **9**

### 4. Inverse Variation – Painters  
Time (t) varies inversely with painters (p).  
4 painters take 6 hours → How many for 3 hours?

tp = k → 4 × 6 = 24 → tp = 24  
3 × p = 24 → p = 24/3 = **8**

**Answer:** **8 painters** needed  
(When time is halved, painters double → 4 × 2 = 8)

### 5. Combined Variation (Direct + Inverse Cube) – Spring Force  
Force F varies directly with stretch distance d  
and inversely with the cube of wire thickness t.  
Given: d = 5 cm, t = 2 mm → F = 40 N

**Part 1 – Equation**  
F = k × d / t³  

40 = k × 5 / 2³  
40 = k × 5/8  
k = 40 × 8/5 = **64**

**Final equation:**  
F = 64 × d / t³

**Part 2 – New situation**  
d = 8 cm, t = 1 mm  

F = 64 × 8 / 1³ = 64 × 8 = **512 N**

**Answer:** **512 newtons**

(Quick check: distance ×1.6, thickness halved → t³ becomes 1/8 original → force ×12.8 → 40 × 12.8 = 512 ✓)
