# Lesson - Variation Equations

## Solutions to Practice Problems

### Question 1: Direct Variation Problem Solution

In this problem, the cost of apples (price, \( y \)) varies directly with their weight (\( x \)). This means the relationship can be expressed as:
\[
y = kx
\]
where \( k \) is the constant of variation (or constant of proportionality).

#### Step 1: Find the Constant \( k \)
We are given that 5 kg of apples costs $12. Substitute the known values into the equation:
\[
12 = k \cdot 5
\]
Solve for \( k \):
\[
k = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4
\]
So, the constant of variation is 2.4 (which means $2.40 per kg).

#### Step 2: Write the Variation Equation
Using the value of \( k \), the equation becomes:
\[
y = 2.4x
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Cost for 8 kg
Now, substitute \( x = 8 \) kg into the equation to find \( y \):
\[
y = 2.4 \cdot 8 = 19.2
\]
Therefore, 8 kg of apples would cost $19.20.

### Question 2: Direct Variation Problem Solution

The distance (\( d \)) a car travels at constant speed varies directly with time (\( t \)).

Given: When \( t = 4 \) hours, \( d = 240 \) km.

#### a) Write the equation of variation
Since distance varies directly with time:
\[
d = kt
\]
Substitute the given values to find \( k \):
\[
240 = k \cdot 4
\]
\[
k = \frac{240}{4} = 60
\]
**Equation of variation:**
\[
d = 60t
\]
(This means the car travels 60 km per hour — a constant speed.)

#### b) How far will the car travel in 7 hours?
Use the equation with \( t = 7 \):
\[
d =  = 60 \cdot 7 = 420
\]
**Answer:** The car will travel **420 kilometers** in 7 hours.

#### c) How long will it take the car to travel 450 kilometers?
Use the equation with \( d = 450 \):
\[
450 = 60t
\]
Solve for \( t \):
\[
t = \frac{450}{60} = 7.5
\]
**Answer:** It will take **7.5 hours** (or 7 hours and 30 minutes) to travel 450 km.

### Summary
- Equation: \( d = 60t \)
- In 7 hours → **420 km**
- 450 km takes → **7.5 hours**

### Question 3: Inverse Variation Problem Solution

**Given:** \( y \) varies inversely with \( x \), and \( y = 12 \) when \( x = 3 \).  
Find \( y \) when \( x = 4 \).

#### Step 1: Write the inverse variation equation
Inverse variation means:
\[
y = \frac{k}{x} \quad \text{or} \quad xy = k
\]
(where \( k \) is the constant of variation)

#### Step 2: Find the constant \( k \)
Use the given values \( y = 12 \) and \( x = 3 \):
\[
xy = k \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 \cdot 12 = k \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 36
\]

#### Step 3: Write the specific equation
\[
xy = 36 \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{36}{x}
\]

#### Step 4: Find \( y \) when \( x = 4 \)
\[
y = \frac{36}{4} = 9
\]

**Answer:** When \( x = 4 \), \( y = 9 \).

### Question 4: Inverse Variation Problem Solution

**Given:**  
The time \( t \) to paint a room varies inversely with the number of painters \( p \).  
When \( p = 4 \) painters, \( t = 6 \) hours.  
Find how many painters are needed to finish in \( t = 3 \) hours.

#### Step 1: Write the inverse variation equation
\[
t = \frac{k}{p} \quad \text{or} \quad t \cdot p = k
\]

#### Step 2: Find the constant \( k \)
Use the known values:
\[
6 \cdot 4 = k \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 24
\]
So the equation is:
\[
t \cdot p = 24
\]

#### Step 3: Find \( p \) when \( t = 3 \) hours
\[
3 \cdot p = 24
\]
\[
p = \frac{24}{3} = 8
\]

**Answer:**  
**8 painters** are needed to paint the room in 3 hours.

(Quick way to remember: when time is halved, you need double the painters → 4 × 2 = 8.)

### Question 5: Combined Direct + Power Inverse Variation Problem – Full Step-by-Step Solution

**Statement Recap**  
The force \( F \)  
- varies directly with the distance stretched \( d \)  
- varies inversely as the cube of the thickness \( t \)

Given: When \( d = 5 \) cm and \( t = 2 \) mm, \( F = 40 \) newtons.

#### Part 1: Write the variation equation and find \( k \) and \( n \)

The combined variation is translated as:
\[
F = k \cdot d \cdot t^{n}
\]
From the problem: “varies inversely as the cube of the thickness” → the exponent on \( t \) must be negative, so
\[
n = -3
\]
Thus the equation is
\[
F = k · \frac{d}{t^{3}}

Now use the given values to find \( k \):

\[
40 = k \cdot \frac{5}{(2)^{3}}
\]
\[
40 = k \cdot \frac{5}{8}
\]
\[
k = 40 \cdot \frac{8}{5} = 8 \cdot 8 = 64
\]

**Final equation:**
\[
F = 64 \cdot \frac{d}{t^{3}}
\]

(or \( F = 64 \, d \, t^{-3}3 \))

#### Part 2: How much force is needed to stretch the spring 8 cm with thickness 1 mm?

Substitute \( d = 8 \) cm and \( t = 1 \) mm into the equation:

\[
F = 64 \cdot \frac{8}{(1)^{3}} =  = 64 \cdot \frac{8}{1} = 64 \cdot 8 = 512
\]

**Answer:**  
512 newtons of force are needed.

(Notice how dramatic the change is: distance increases by a factor of 8/5 = 1.6, but thickness is halved, so the denominator \( t^3 \) becomes 1/8 of its original value → overall force increases by 1.6 × 8 = 12.8 times the original 40 N, and 40 × 12.8 = 512 N. Checks out!)
