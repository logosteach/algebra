# Common Mistakes Made on the First Exam

## 1. Evaluating expressions is not yet fully understood.

### a) The student does not use parentheses when replacing a variable with a number.

**Example:** For the expression $x^2 - y^2 + 3$ where $x = 2$ and $y = -3$.

**Mistake:** Substituting without parentheses might lead to calculating $y^2$ as $-3^2 = -9$ instead of $(-3)^2 = 9$. This results in $2^2 - (-9) + 3 = 4 + 9 + 3 = 16$, which is incorrect. The correct substitution requires $(-3)^2 = 9$, yielding $4 - 9 + 3 = -2$.

**Explanation:** Parentheses ensure the order of operations is followed correctly for negative bases in exponents. Without them, the negative sign is misinterpreted as applying to the entire power rather than the base.
