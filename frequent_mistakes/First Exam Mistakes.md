# Common Mistakes Made on the First Exam

## 1. Evaluating expressions is not yet fully understood.

Students often make errors when substituting values into algebraic expressions, particularly with negative numbers and exponents.

### a) The student does not use parentheses when replacing a variable with a number.

**Example:** For the expression \( x^2 - y^2 + 3 \) where \( x = 2 \) and \( y = -3 \).

**Mistake:** Substituting without parentheses might lead to calculating \( y^2 \) as \( -3^2 = -9 \) instead of \( (-3)^2 = 9 \). This results in \( 2^2 - (-9) + 3 = 4 + 9 + 3 = 16 \), which is incorrect. The correct substitution requires \( (-3)^2 = 9 \), yielding \( 4 - 9 + 3 = -2 \).

**Explanation:** Parentheses ensure the order of operations is followed correctly for negative bases in exponents. Without them, the negative sign is misinterpreted as applying to the entire power rather than the base.

## 2. The student has not yet learned that there are cases when they cannot use the double negative rule because of the order of operations.

**Example:** \( 5^2 - (-3)^2 \) or \( -|-3| \).

**Mistake:** For \( 5^2 - (-3)^2 \), students might incorrectly apply a double negative to get \( 25 - (-9) = 34 \), but the correct evaluation follows PEMDAS: exponents first, so \( (-3)^2 = 9 \), then \( 25 - 9 = 16 \). For \( -|-3| \), students might think it's \( -(-3) = 3 \), but absolute value first gives \( |-3| = 3 \), so \( -3 = -3 \).

**Explanation:** The double negative rule (\( -- = + \)) doesn't override the order of operations. Exponents and absolute values must be evaluated before subtraction or negation, preventing premature simplification.

## 3. The student interprets a phrase like "twelve less than five times a number \( y \)" as \( 12 - 5y \).

**Mistake:** Writing \( 12 - 5y \) instead of the correct \( 5y - 12 \).

**Explanation:** The phrase "twelve less than" means subtracting 12 from the result of "five times a number \( y \)", so multiplication precedes subtraction. This is a common issue with verbal translation to algebraic expressions, where the order of operations in English doesn't match the student's assumption.

## 4. The student does not understand the meaning of the word "quotient". The student reads a phrase like "the quotient of 12 and \( y \)" and writes it as \( 12y \) or perhaps \( y/12 \).

**Mistake:** Interpreting "quotient" as multiplication (\( 12y \)) or reversing the division (\( y/12 \)) instead of \( 12 / y \).

**Explanation:** "Quotient" specifically means the result of division, with the dividend first (12) divided by the divisor (\( y \)). This vocabulary gap leads to confusion between division and multiplication or incorrect order in division.

## 5. The student still struggles with simplifying expressions.

Students often mishandle combining like terms, distributing negatives, or basic arithmetic in algebraic contexts.

### a) \( 5x - 5x + 3y + 2y = x + 5y \)

**Mistake:** Simplifying to \( x + 5y \) instead of \( 5y \).

**Explanation:** \( 5x - 5x = 0 \), not \( x \); students may subtract coefficients incorrectly as \( (5-5)x = 0x \), but forget it's zero. Then \( 3y + 2y = 5y \). The error is in not recognizing that equal coefficients cancel completely to zero.

### b) \( 6x - (-y + 7x) + 1 = 6x + y - 7x = -1xy \)

**Mistake:** Distributing the negative incorrectly to get \( 6x + y - 7x = -x + y \), then erroneously writing \( -1xy \) (treating it as a product).

**Explanation:** Correct distribution: \( 6x - (-y + 7x) + 1 = 6x + y - 7x + 1 = -x + y + 1 \). The mistake occurs in mishandling the negative sign over the parentheses and then confusing subtraction with multiplication.

### c) \( -3 - 5 = -2 \)

**Mistake:** Calculating as \( -2 \) instead of \( -8 \).

**Explanation:** Subtracting a positive is equivalent to adding the negative: \( -3 + (-5) = -8 \). Students often treat the second minus as reducing the magnitude incorrectly, forgetting that subtracting positive decreases the value further for negatives.

## 6. The student does not understand what an irrational number truly is yet.

**Example:** The student gives \( 3.14 \), \( 2.34567 \), or even \( \frac{11}{9} \) as an irrational number.

**Mistake:** Listing finite decimals or fractions as irrational.

**Explanation:** Irrational numbers cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers and have non-terminating, non-repeating decimals (e.g., \( \pi \), \( \sqrt{2} \)). \( 3.14 = \frac{314}{100} \) is rational; \( 2.34567 = \frac{234567}{100000} \) is rational; \( \frac{11}{9} = 1.\overline{2} \) is rational. The error stems from confusing approximations of irrationals with exact rationals.

## 7. The student still struggles with unit conversions, such as: Convert 25 miles per hour into feet per second.

**Example:** \( 25 \) miles per hour to feet per second.

**Mistake:** Common errors include forgetting conversion factors (1 mile = 5280 feet, 1 hour = 3600 seconds) or incorrect setup, e.g., dividing instead of multiplying appropriately, leading to answers like 0.007 or 90,000 without simplification.

**Explanation:** Students often mix up numerator/denominator or omit steps, highlighting the need for dimensional analysis to track units systematically.

**Correct Step-by-Step Process:**

1. Start with the given value: \( 25 \) miles per hour, which is \( 25 \ \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}} \).

2. Convert miles to feet: Multiply by the conversion factor \( \frac{5280 \ \text{feet}}{1 \ \text{mile}} \), so \( 25 \times 5280 \ \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{hour}} \).

3. Convert hours to seconds: Multiply by the conversion factor \( \frac{1 \ \text{hour}}{3600 \ \text{seconds}} \) (or divide by 3600), so \( \frac{25 \times 5280}{3600} \ \frac{\text{feet}}{\text{second}} \).

4. Simplify the fraction: First, reduce \( \frac{5280}{3600} = \frac{528}{360} = \frac{264}{180} = \frac{132}{90} = \frac{66}{45} = \frac{22}{15} \).

5. Multiply by 25: \( 25 \times \frac{22}{15} = \frac{25 \times 22}{15} = \frac{550}{15} = \frac{110}{3} \approx 36.67 \) feet per second.

This step-by-step approach ensures units cancel properly and helps avoid errors in placement of conversion factors.
