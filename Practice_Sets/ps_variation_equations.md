### Direct Variation (1–6)
1. y varies directly with x. (Begin with $y = kx$) If y = 15 when x = 5, find y when x = 12.  
2. The cost C varies directly with the number of pounds p. 8 pounds cost $28. How much do 15 pounds cost?  
3. Distance d varies directly with time t. A car goes 180 miles in 3 hours. How far does it go in 7 hours?  
4. The pay P varies directly with hours worked h. Juan earns $117 for 9 hours. How much does he earn for 40 hours?  
5. Force F varies directly with mass m. A 12-kg object needs 48 N of force. How much force for a 20-kg object?  
6. The length L of a spring varies directly with the weight W hanging on it. A 10-N weight stretches it 4 cm. How far does a 25-N weight stretch it?

### Inverse Variation (7–12)
7. y varies inversely with x. (Begin with $y=\frac{k}{x}$) If y = 20 when x = 6, find y when x = 10.  
8. Time t varies inversely with speed s. A trip takes 5 hours at 60 km/h. How long at 80 km/h?  
9. The time t to paint a house varies inversely with the number of painters p. 6 painters take 15 hours. How many painters to finish in 10 hours?  
10. Pressure P varies inversely with volume V. If P = 80 when V = 30, find P when V = 50.  
11. The number of days d to finish a job varies inversely with workers w. 12 workers finish in 20 days. How many days with 30 workers?  
12. Illumination I varies inversely with the square of distance d from a light. If I = 100 when d = 3 m, find I when d = 6 m.

### Joint Variation (13–18)
13. z varies jointly with x and y. (Begin with $z = kxy$) If z = 24 when x = 3 and y = 4, find z when x = 5 and y = 6.  
14. Volume V varies jointly with length l, w, and h. A box 2 m × 3 m × 4 m has volume 24 m³. What is the volume of a 5 m × 5 m × 2 m box?  
15. The cost C of a party varies jointly with number of guests g and hours h. 20 guests for 3 hours cost $360. How much for 30 guests for 5 hours?  
16. Power P varies jointly with current I and resistance R. P = 48 when I = 4 and R = 3. Find P when I = 6 and R = 5.  
17. The area A of a triangle varies jointly with base b and height h. A = 60 when b = 10 and h = 12. Find A when b = 15 and h = 8.  
18. Force F varies jointly with masses m₁ and m₂ and inversely with distance r. (Use F = k · m₁·m₂ / r)  
   If F = 20 when m₁ = 5, m₂ = 8, r = 4, find F when m₁ = 10, m₂ = 6, r = 3.

### Combined & Power Variation (19–25)
19. y varies directly with x and inversely with w. (Begin with $y=\frac{kx}{w}$) y = 18 when x = 9 and w = 3. Find y when x = 20 and w = 5.  
20. Time t varies directly with distance d and inversely with speed s. A 300-km trip at 60 km/h takes 5 hours. How long at 75 km/h?  
21. Force F varies directly with d and inversely with the square of t. F = 50 when d = 10 and t = 2. Find F when d = 15 and t = 3.  
22. The weight W a beam can support varies directly with its width w and the square of its depth h, and inversely with its length L.  
    A beam 4 cm wide, 8 cm deep, and 200 cm long supports 600 kg.  
    How much can a beam 5 cm wide, 10 cm deep, and 250 cm long support?  
23. Kinetic energy KE varies directly with mass m and as the square of speed v.  
    A 4-kg object moving at 5 m/s has KE = 200 units.  
    Find KE for a 6-kg object moving at 10 m/s.  
24. The electrical resistance R of a wire varies directly with its length L and inversely with the square of its diameter d.  
    A 100-m wire with diameter 2 mm has resistance 8 ohms.  
    What is the resistance of a 150-m wire with diameter 4 mm?  
25. ★ CHALLENGE ★  
    The time t to fill a tank varies directly with the volume V of the tank and inversely with the square of the pipe radius r.  
    A tank of 1200 liters is filled in 8 minutes using a pipe of radius 3 cm.  
    How long will it take to fill a 2000-liter tank using a pipe of radius 4 cm?

**Show all work on separate paper. Good luck!**

This set gradually increases in difficulty.  
Problems 24 and 25 are the two hardest (multi-step combined power variation), but every step uses only skills from Algebra 1: proportions, exponents as repeated multiplication, and solving simple equations.
